Generate a new application key

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000


**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data which includes users. This can help you to quickly start testing the api with ready content.**

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
